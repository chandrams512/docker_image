After running Docker image,we have to go inside Dockernodejs folder

and run these command step by step

```  

npm install   

service postgresql start

sudo -u postgres psql

ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'root';

CREATE TABLE scl_user(
        user_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
        username text NOT NULL,
        password text NOT NULL,
        email text NOT NULL,
        mobile_no text NOT NULL,
        created_on date,

        last_login date,
        login_attempts integer);
